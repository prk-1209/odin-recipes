Total beginner here!

In this project skills in Terminal use, HTML, Git and GitHub are practiced.

All the commands in the project are done from the Terminal using OS pc.
Pages are created in VisualCode by using HTML code for links, lists and images representing a basic website of my favorite daily meal recipes.

This is the second time odin-recipes is made and uploaded to GitHub. In the previous I did some things too early and work was not done as it should be, so I've deleted the repository and made a new one.

As a start I made GitHub repository, that I copied locally with the command 'git clone'.
All git adds and git commits were made every time after creating a new file and repository locally, while following the steps of the course 'Project: Recipes' from The Odin Project. 
I added an empty README in the beginning to fill out later as a self-reflection after finishing the assignment.
At the end I revised and corrected the text on some of the pages locally and git committed them with messages describing what exactly has changed and for which reason.

Thank you for reading!
